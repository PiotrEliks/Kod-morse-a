# About 📄
MORSECommunication System is designed for encoding and decoding messages using Morse code. The project facilitates message conversion, with one group responsible for encoding natural language into Morse code and another for decoding it back. The information is exchanged as XML files, with validation through an accompanying XSD schema to ensure data integrity.
# Technologies 💻
- **XML/XSD:** XML files are used for message exchange, and XSD for schema validation.
- **React.js:** For building the user interface of the web application.

    - Enter a natural language message and submit to encode into Morse code.
    - Download the resulting Morse code as an XML file.
- **Decoding Messages**:
    - Receive the XML file, validate it, and decode the Morse code back into natural language.
- **File Exchange**:
    - The encoded Morse code is sent as an XML file, and validation is performed using the XSD schema.
